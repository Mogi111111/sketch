# Stand-alone demo pages for sketch web components

These are handy for iterating on specific component UI issues in isolation from the rest of the sketch application, and without having to start a full backend to serve the full frontend app UI.

See [README](../../../readme.md#development-mode) for more information on how to run the demo pages.
